**What is this?**

Some protos I coded for Stephane Maarek's course [Complete Guide to Protocol Buffers 3](https://www.udemy.com/course/protocol-buffers/).

**What did I learn?**

How to:
- Write simple and complex protobufs
- Use protoc
- Generate Java, JS, Python and Go code from profobufs
- Evolve protobufs in a safe way
- Use advanced data types (oneof, Duration, etc.)

**How was the course?**

I use protos at my job, but it was nice to relearn the basics and discover new functionalities. Stephane doesn't waste your time in this course.
