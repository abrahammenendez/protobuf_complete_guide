**What is this?**

The complete webapp I made for Sergey Kargopolov's course [Spring Boot Microservices with Spring Cloud](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-microservices-and-spring-cloud/).

**What did I learn?**

How to:
- Write simple and complex protobufs
- Use the protoc
- Generate Java, JS, Python and Go code from profobufs
- Evolve protobufs in a safe way
- Use advanced data types (oneof, Duration, etc.)

**How was the course?**

I use protos at my job, but it was nice to relearn the basics and discover new functionalities. Stephane doesn't waste your time in this course.

**Additional info**

For the past six years I've taken a lot of courses in my free time. Sadly, I never thought about compiling them into a list. Since 2019, I've been trying to write down (and rate) every new course I take. You can see it [here](https://github.com/abrahammenendez/courses/).
